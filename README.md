# hidemy.name
hidemy.name grabber&amp;checker 
To download all proxies with hidemy.name use grabber.py, when done it will create "resaults" folder where you will find .txt files for each type of proxy in type:ip:port format.

To check proxies use checker.py, it takes proxies from "resaults" folder and checks them. For your convenience, you can select the website to which you want to connect, the type of proxy to check and the maximum timeout (the amount of time that is given for a response). Once done, it will create a "goods" folder where you will find .txt files for each type of proxy (that you have chosen) in ip:port format.

allinone.py runs grabber.py and checker.py in sequence for your convenience :)
